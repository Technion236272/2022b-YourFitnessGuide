Kayyal: I think it's better if we just let them access home page without logging
in and if someone wants to log in they can go to profile

if we kept it this way we need to change the decoration in sign in page

- I think it is better if we used for example import 'package:yourfitnessguide/utils/TEST'
 instead of import '../utils/TEST'
